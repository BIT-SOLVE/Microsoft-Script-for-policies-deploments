# win32 App Deployment automated

I have many different customers who basically need the same / similar base of win32 apps in Endpoint Manager. Maintaining the apps every time with the intunewin file, the name, the publisher, installation commands etc. is not a very satisfying job. That's why I created a repository with a software list and a PowerShell script that automates the win32 app deployment.
